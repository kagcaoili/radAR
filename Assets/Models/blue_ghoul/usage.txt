USAGE:
1) Import package to your unity project
2) Drag Blue Ghoul Prefab into your viewport window
3) Character comes with Animation controller which animates its Idle Animation as a default state
4) You can use your scripts or game logic to animate the character
5) For setting up your animations keep in mind:

* IDLE state is meant to be characters default state before noticing the player

* After character notices the player your game logic should put the character into STAND state
  (play animation IDLE_TO_STAND - which is a reaction animation)

* From STAND state (which you can make your DEFAULT state)

* you can animate all attacks, gethit animation, die animation etc... 
  STAND is meant to be a default state from which your character will go into other animations

* DIE animation automatically transitions into DEAD animation 

* locomotion and idle animations are looped
